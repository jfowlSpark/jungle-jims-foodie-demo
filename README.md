# Jungle Jim's International Foodie Adventure (Demo)

This is a fully interactive, mobile-friendly demo of a proposed in-store scavenger hunt for **Jungle Jim’s International Market**.

Shoppers are guided by **Chef Giovanni “The Globe-Trotting Gourmet” Rossi**, who provides audio clues leading them through different areas of the store to collect ingredients for a real Jungle Jim’s recipe — **Italian Pasta & Spinach Bake**.

This demo shows how the experience could work inside the Jungle Jim’s mobile app or website, using pre-scripted “AI-style” audio and tappable “scan” buttons instead of real barcode scanning.
